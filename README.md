Description:
 
Whether you were born in Asia, or in America, this quiz tests your challenge in your knowledge about the different communities as well as poking fun at stereotypes. This quiz is not serious in any way! 
 
The term Asian American is one that encompasses a wide spectrum of communities with different cultural backgrounds and experiences. Asian Americans range from East Asians, South Asians, Southeast Asians, and Pacific Islanders. Not many people are aware of the complexity behind the term. Despite it being such a big community, many of us still feel alienated or have a sense of imposter syndrome within our respective communities. This raises the question I’ve always asked myself, what does it mean to be Asian? What makes me proud to be Asian? I hope this portion of the tool helps bring a sense of comfort, community, and belonging to those that might feel lost and alone.


Progress:
When trying to create a concept for this project, my mind immediately gravitated towards either the Asian American community or the Chinese-Indonesian community. Prior to this, I went to an event for a company called Mindset- the company is ran by three Korean brothers and is centered around the distigmatization of mental health in Asia. There was a discussion that took place where people shared the struggle they felt with finding a sense of community within Asian Americans, and how Mindset essentially filled that whole for them. Through the discussions that took place, I was very passionate about creating a tool that, while light-hearted and simple on the surface, had a deeper meaningh that helped my users feel a sense of belonging. 

The initial prompt was :
I plan to create a tool that will serve as a common denominator within Asian American communities; this will be done through both shared experiences, traditions, and interests. Despite the fact that there are over 22 million Asian Americans in America, so many of us still feel alienated or have a sense of imposter syndrome within our respective communities. Of these 22 million, there are over 20 different countries, meaning there are numerous sub-communities. I wanted to create this tool to help bring a sense of comfort, community, and belonging to those that might feel lost and alone.

It was essentially a tool that allowed users to realize that there were others with shared experiences or interests as them. However, while I felt very strongly about this concept, I also wasn’t familiar with local storage so I was very concerned, especially with time restaurants about wtherb or not I would be able to complete it on time. So I came up with a second idea that seemed far simpler to execute:
 
Another idea that I had was a tool to help guide you in finding the right career path for you. 
This idea stems from the familial pressure and obligation both immigrant families -or families in general put on us. The feeling that we need to take on the path laid out for us instead of what we truly want to do. Often, we end up accomplishing our parent's or parental figure's dreams before pursuing our own. When deciding on which path to walk on, people always tell us to weigh our options; what are the pros and cons? This tool is essentially a visualizer of this. 
Inputs two different career paths and uses tool to weigh pros and cons 
In the end it outputs their preferred path
 
In the end, I ended up going for the first idea I had, but with a little twist. Instead of it being formatted in a way that asked about the person’s culture, I was inspired by the rice purity test to create a more satire, light-hearted quiz. The quiz essentially has very basic trivia about Asian Americans, as well as some very stereotypical traits within the community. I wanted my audience to feel a little more comfortable before having the answer the final question. Once they type out a response, it sends them to a page with a short descirpon as well as a bunch odf words shooting at you. These words are previous reponses! 
 
I chose not to show the description of the purpose of the tool until after they saved the information because I did not want any bias or to put any pressure on my users.

Reflection:
One thing I struggled with the most was whether or not putting more .html pages would make more sense, or just to condense into one. My first handmade website has over 7 pages and while it did feel overwhelming at the time, I realized that it actually helped me keep track of everything. I also couldn’t figure out how to make the ‘save’ button go to the next page whilst simultaneously saving the input into the storage. I want to also add more interactive elements like some rice grains falling, having the text turn red when you hover over it. One important thing that I really hope to figure out how to implement is to save previous users answers. Right now, all the text (except ONE) are responses I got from a survey I conducted amongst my friends as I wasn’t able to get it to work. Ultimately I want people to be able to come back to that portion of the website incase they feel alone or unheard. I want to find a way to implement a sense of community by having an option to be anonymous, or have their information posted alongside their response.
